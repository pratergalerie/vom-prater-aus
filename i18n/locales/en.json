In the Prater Hall and on the open-air stage, the summer theater, rope dancers were performed in a convivial round: interior acrobatics and boxing matches, but it was also a place of political agitation and discussion. Even with the growing and changing city, the Prater remained central for the neighborhood, where they eaten, drank, discussed, danced and celebrated. Today the Volksb√ºhne and Prater Gallery are located here as important places of the free art scene.",
