The Prater soon began hosting shows and musical events in the hall and on the open-air stage. Orchestras performed, and countless visitors enjoyed summer theatre performances, afternoon dances, variety shows featuring tightrope acrobatics at dizzying heights and wrestling matches. The billiard salon was also a popular attraction. Renowned artists from far and wide found their way onto the Prater's stages.",

To bypass the beverage licensing laws, only hot water and the utensils needed for making coffee were provided. Guests had to bring their own ground coffee. This tradition dated back to the 18th century and probably originated in the garden taverns of Treptow. There, migrants from Saxony sold coffee to people out for a stroll. When the Berlin Magistrate denied them a license to serve beverages, they instead offered only hot water and provided the necessary coffee-making equipment for a fee. This practice spread throughout Berlin and the surrounding area, remaining common in some beer gardens right up until the 1950s."

No wonder these venues were so popular among Berlin's citizens, young and old. On pleasant summer weekends, they were real hotspots, attracting droves of Berliners."

Unlike the ubiquitous prefab housing architecture of the GDR, cultural buildings were allowed a certain degree of eccentricity – a trait also evident in other well-known works by Rubinow, such as the Stadthalle in Karl-Marx-Stadt (present-day Chemnitz).",

Over the years, visitor numbers steadily increased until the Prater could no longer accommodate the crowds.

After intense discussions, it remained in the hands of the district council but was then closed for several years due to seemingly never-ending construction work.
