            "p1": "Opened in the 1830s as a beer garden just outside the city gates, the Berlin Prater has always been a big draw for people seeking relaxation and entertainment in the open air – regardless of class or cultural background. The Prater soon began hosting shows and musical events in the hall and on the open-air stage. Orchestras performed, and countless visitors enjoyed summer theatre performances, afternoon dances, variety shows featuring tightrope acrobatics at dizzying heights and wrestling matches. The billiard salon was also a popular attraction. Renowned artists from far and wide found their way onto the Prater's stages.",

It shows the Prater façade at Kastanienallee No.7, with the 1875 archway, the dance and events room, as well as the garden with its summer stage, as well as the open-air hall that housed shooting galleries and vendor's booths."

To bypass the beverage licensing laws, only hot water and the utensils needed for making coffee were provided. Guests had to bring their own ground coffee. This tradition dated back to the 18th century and probably originated in the garden taverns of Treptow. There, migrants from Saxony sold coffee to people out for a stroll. When the Berlin Magistrate denied them a license to serve beverages, they instead offered only hot water and provided the necessary coffee-making equipment for a fee. This practice spread throughout Berlin and the surrounding area, remaining common in some beer gardens right up until the 1950s."

No wonder these venues were so popular among Berlin's citizens, young and old. On pleasant summer weekends, they were real hotspots, attracting droves of Berliners."

Designed by architects Wladimir Rubinow and Udo Schultz, it is a particularly fine example of postwar modernist architecture, due to its dynamic form. Unlike the ubiquitous prefab housing architecture of the GDR, cultural buildings were allowed a certain degree of eccentricity – a trait also evident in other well-known works by Rubinow, such as the Stadthalle in Karl-Marx-Stadt (present-day Chemnitz).",

Its dynamic design allowed, among other things, for greater audience participation during performances, making it a versatile venue. With events aimed at all generations, it was an inclusive and engaging venue."

The 40 to 50 amateur art groups of the district also found space in the Prater for their rehearsals and performances. Over the years, visitor numbers steadily increased until the Prater could no longer accommodate the crowds. In the spring of 1986, a large portion of the cultural activities was relocated to a new cultural centre in Ernst-Thälmann Park."

After intense discussions, it remained in the hands of the district council but was then closed for several years due to seemingly never-ending construction work. It was only when the Volksbühne, under the artistic direction of Frank Castorf, expressed interest in using the Prater hall that the renovations were finally completed, allowing the Volksbühne to begin operations there in 1995."
